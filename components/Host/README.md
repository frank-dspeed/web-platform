# HostComponent
The Host component allows you to abstract diffrent platforms and architectures into diffrent sets of components specific for each platform and arch.
It is a Component Layer to allow you to write components that integrate into the Platform eg: Content dependens on this it bundles lower layers like
diffrent Rendering Engines into a Unified Component layer if you would want to create something like special optimized builds for at present none supported hardware
this is the place to go,
